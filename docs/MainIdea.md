# TermiTunes Music Player

## Motivation

We all listen to music a lot while driving or riding the bus, while doing sport or while working. But especially when we
work we want our music to be easily controllable, easy to access or just run in the background, but the UI of most 
streaming platforms are often slow or clunky to use... I want to change that. 

With TermiTunes you can listen to your favourite songs from spotify with just one command or by using the superfast
Terminal based UI. You want to listen to a song that is not available on spotify or that you created yourself? No 
problem, just add the wav or mp3 file into a designated directory, and you can access it like all your other songs or 
even include it in your already existing Playlists.

## in short

- listen to spotify / local songs directly from the terminal
- optional terminal UI or daemon mode

UI is faster and easier to use than standard UI.
